### Overview
Equester will be a web application designed to provide equestrians with a platform to build profiles for their horses -- like a LinkedIn with hooves. These profiles can then be used to track vet and farrier visits, log trail miles, record awards and competitions, list horses for sale, and then transfer the profile upon purchase. Horses will also be able to receive endorsements for having specific skills, traits, and aptitudes. With these searchable endorsements, potential buyers can narrow their search now not only by traditional means such as breed, age, and gender, but also by skill, aptitude, and background. With Equester, they can be assured that the horse they choose is the perfect fit for them. 

The basic MVP that I will focus on for this course will include Single Sign-on with Facebook,Google (at least). Users will be able to create a profile for their horses and log events.
